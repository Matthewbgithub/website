            <h3>What is this?</h3>
        </p>
        <p>This is a pedestrian crossing that used to be in service in Redhill. I recieved this as a present and realised the button; while present and functional, did not serve any function, and that just can't be.</p>
        <p>I added a raspberry pi zero w to the inside of the crossing, wiring up a dual relay hat to the two lights allowing them to be controlled by the pi.</p>
        <p>When the button is pressed the green and red lights flash imitating a pedestrian crossing. It also sends an email to me listing the time, date, and count of how many times the button has been pressed.</p>
        <p>The code is a simple python script.</p>
